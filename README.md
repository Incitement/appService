This repository is for training a group of individuals how to do things. 

Using ASP.NET Core, this builds pages that allow accessibility to:

  - Google
  
  - Microsoft
  
  - Custom SQL
  
  - Github
  
  - Magic Telepathy 
  
The custom SQL form currently consists of Username and Password fields, allowing entries to a local DB to add credentials with our forms.
